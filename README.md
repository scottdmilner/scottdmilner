## Hello 👋

My name is Scott, I'm a Computer Science student studying CG/Animation/CFX pipelines at Brigham Young University 🛠⚙️. 

I'm currently deep in my senior capstone—an animated short about a meet-cute in a crypt. I've architected our pipeline from scratch, feel free to check out all my work at [dungeon-pipeline](https://github.com/scottdmilner/dungeon-pipeline)!

Big into: USD, Houdini, board games, and 400 year-old music

Other favorite projects/highlights:

- [PipeBot](https://github.com/scottdmilner/pipebot) — a Discord bot to help artists that don't have GitHub accounts open GitHub issues and process ~~ShotGrid~~ Flow Production Tracking webhooks
- [accomplice_pipe](https://github.com/Student-Accomplice-Pipeline-Team/accomplice_pipe) — a short film pipeline I contributed to for the BYU Center for Animation 2024 student film ***Student Accomplice***. ***Student Accomplice*** [won a Student Academy Award](https://press.oscars.org/news/academy-reveals-2024-student-academy-awardr-winners) as well as the [Rookies Film of the Year](https://www.therookies.co/contests/403/results).

- [tractor-https](https://github.com/scottdmilner/tractor-https) — Dockerized deployment of Pixar's Tractor Engine with HTTPS via nginx instead of the default HTTP. This allows secure server-side authentication, such as with a PAM module. Currently deployed at Brigham Young University.
