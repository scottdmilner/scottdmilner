## Hello 👋

My name is Scott, I'm a Computer Science student studying CG/Animation/CFX pipelines at Brigham Young University 🛠⚙️. 

I'm currently deep in my senior capstone—an animated short about a meet-cute in a crypt. I've architected our pipeline from scratch, feel free to check it out at [dungeon-pipeline](https://github.com/scottdmilner/dungeon-pipeline)!

Big into: USD, Houdini, board games, and 400 year-old music
